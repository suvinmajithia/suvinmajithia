# Hi, I'm Suvin 👋

I work at the intersection of **Cybersecurity and Machine Learning**, building models for threat detection, fraud monitoring, and anomaly detection.

- 💼 Experience: Data Protection @ RBC, Security Analyst, ML projects across fraud, DDoS, and cyber logs
- 🧠 Focus: UEBA-style anomaly detection, fraud model drift, threat detection on logs
- 🛠 Tech: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Splunk, Imperva DSF, Azure

## 🔐 ML + Security Projects

- **Cyber Threat Detection with Deep Learning (PyTorch)**  
  Binary classifier on cyber logs (BETH dataset) using a feedforward network with weighted loss. Achieved ~0.969 F1 on a heavily imbalanced dataset.

- **Fraud Model Monitoring & Drift Analysis**  
  Production-style fraud model diagnostics using CBPE and drift metrics to detect performance degradation and feature drift, with clear business impact narrative.

- **Financial Chatbot (BCG Simulation)**  
  Data cleaning + analysis on financial datasets and a rule-based NLP chatbot (NLTK) to answer business queries from structured data.

- **Customer Churn Optimization (BCG DS Simulation)**  
  Fixed a useless model (5.5% recall) by focusing on class imbalance and threshold tuning, increasing recall to ~38% for at-risk customers.

- **Green Vancouver – Tree Species Visualization**  
  Altair-based EDA and visualization on Vancouver’s street trees, focusing on neighborhood biodiversity and geospatial patterns.

- **MonReader – Page Flip Detection (CNN)**  
  CNN model to detect page flips from images (92% accuracy, 93% F1), supporting an accessibility-focused document scanning workflow.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

Roles where I can apply **ML to Security**, including:

- Security Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Threat Detection  
- Detection Engineering with ML (UEBA, anomaly, fraud, DDoS)  
- AI Security / ML for Security Analytics
- I am a Canadian citizen and am eligible to work in the United States; I will require employer sponsorship for U.S.-based roles
